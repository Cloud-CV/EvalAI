## Auto-Scaling Script

**Purpose:**
The auto-scaling script automatically adjusts the number of instances in your AWS environment based on predefined metrics and thresholds.

**How It Works:**
1. **Metrics Monitoring:** The script monitors specific metrics (e.g., CPU usage, memory usage) to determine when scaling is needed.
2. **Scaling Actions:** Based on the metrics, the script scales up or down the number of instances.
3. **Configuration:** You can configure thresholds and scaling policies in the script settings.

**Usage:**
1. **Setup:** [Instructions for setting up the script, including required permissions and configurations.]
2. **Execution:** [How to run the script, including any command-line options or parameters.]
3. **Monitoring:** [How to check the script’s status and ensure it’s functioning correctly.]

**Risks and Warnings:**
- **Liability:** We are not liable for any failures or issues that arise from using this script. Ensure that you thoroughly test the script in a staging environment before deploying it in production.
- **AWS Usage:** Regularly check your AWS usage and costs. If auto-scaling fails, you may need to manually scale down resources to prevent unexpected charges.
- **Support:** If you encounter issues with auto-scaling, please contact us for support. We can help diagnose and address problems related to the script’s functionality.

## Auto-Cancel Script

**Purpose:**
The auto-cancel script is designed to automatically terminate instances or resources based on specific conditions or schedules.

**How It Works:**
1. **Condition Monitoring:** The script monitors conditions (e.g., idle time, resource usage) to determine when to cancel resources.
2. **Cancellation Actions:** The script cancels or terminates resources according to predefined rules.
3. **Configuration:** Customize the conditions and rules for cancellation in the script settings.

**Usage:**
1. **Setup:** [Instructions for setting up the script, including necessary permissions and configurations.]
2. **Execution:** [How to run the script, including any command-line options or parameters.]
3. **Monitoring:** [How to verify the script’s operation and ensure proper functioning.]

**Risks and Warnings:**
- **Liability:** We are not liable for any failures or issues that occur while using this script. Test the script thoroughly before using it in a live environment.
- **AWS Usage:** Monitor your AWS usage to avoid unexpected costs. If auto-cancellation fails, you might need to manually manage resources to prevent overcharges.
- **Support:** Contact us if you experience issues with the auto-cancel script. We offer support for troubleshooting and resolving script-related problems.

## General Guidelines

1. **Testing:** Always test scripts in a staging environment before deploying them to production.
2. **Monitoring:** Regularly check your resource usage and script performance to ensure they are working as expected.
3. **Updates:** Keep the scripts updated to align with any changes in AWS services or your environment.
