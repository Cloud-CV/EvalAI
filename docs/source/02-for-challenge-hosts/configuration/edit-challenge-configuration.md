After a challenge has been created on EvalAI, you may need to update some fieldsâ€”like changing submission limits, fixing typos, or adjusting dates. This guide explains **which fields can be edited**, **how to request updates**, and **how to test configuration changes locally**.

## Editable Fields

All the fields in the challenge config YAML can typically be updated, except the following:

`challenge_phase_splits`
`dataset_splits`
