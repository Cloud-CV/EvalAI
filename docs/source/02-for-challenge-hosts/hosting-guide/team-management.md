# Team Management

Challenge host teams allow multiple organizers to manage a challenge together. As a host team admin, you can add other hosts to your team and assign them permissions.

## Adding Hosts to a Team

To add a new host to your challenge host team:

1.  **Navigate to Host Teams**: Go to the [Host Teams](https://eval.ai/web/teams/hosts) page.
2.  **Select your Team**: Click on the team you want to manage.
3.  **Invite Host**: Click on the **Add Member** icon (user with a plus sign) on the team card.
4.  **Enter Email**: In the modal that appears, enter the email address of the organizer you want to invite.
    -   **Note**: The user must already have an account on EvalAI.
5.  **Success**: Once invited, the user will be added to your host team.

## Removing Hosts from a Team

Only the host team admin can remove other hosts from a team.

1.  **Navigate to Host Teams**: Go to the [Host Teams](https://eval.ai/web/teams/hosts) page.
2.  **View Members**: On the team card, you will see a list of current "Team Members".
3.  **Remove Member**: Click the **Trash** icon next to the name of the host you wish to remove.
4.  **Confirm**: The host will be removed from the team immediately.

## Leaving a Host Team

If you are a member of a host team, you can remove yourself from the team:

1.  **Navigate to Host Teams**: Go to the [Host Teams](https://eval.ai/web/teams/hosts) page.
2.  **Remove Self**: Find the team and click the **Trash** icon next to your own name.

> [!NOTE]
> Deleting yourself from a host team will remove your access to all challenges managed by that team.
