Welcome to EvalAI's documentation!
==================================


EvalAI_ is an open source platform for evaluating and comparing machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence algorithms (AI) at scale.

It is built to provide a scalable solution to the research community to fulfill the critical need of evaluating machine learning models and agents acting in an environment against annotations or with a human-in-the-loop.
