#### Q. How to setup EvalAI using virtualenv?

We have removed the documentation for setting up using virtual environment since the project has grown and different developers face different dependency issues. We recommend to setup EvalAI using docker based environment.

### Common Errors during installation

#### Q. While using `pip install -r dev/requirement.txt`

```
  Writing manifest file 'pip-egg-info/psycopg2.egg-info/SOURCES.txt'

#### Q. While using docker, I am getting the following error on URL [http://localhost:8888/](http://localhost:8888/):

```
Cannot Get \
```

Try removing the docker containers and then building them again.

#### Q. Getting the following error while running `python manage.py seed`:

```
Starting the database seeder. Hang on... Exception while running run() in 'scripts.seed' Database successfully seeded
```

Change the python version to 2.7.x . The problem might be because of the python 3.0 version.

#### Q. Getting the following error while executing command `createdb evalai -U postgres`:

```
createdb: could not connect to database template1: FATAL: Peer authentication failed for user "postgres"
```

Try creating a new user and then grant all the privileges to it and then create a db.

#### Q. Getting the following error while executing `npm install`:

```
npm WARN generator-angular@0.16.0 requires a peer of generator-
karma@>=0.9.0 but none was installed.
```

Uninstall and then install karma again and also don't forget to clean the global as well as project npm cache. Then try again the step 8.

#### Q. While running the unit tests, I am getting the error similar to as shown below:

```
________________ ERROR collecting tests/unit/web/test_views.py _________________
import file mismatch:
imported module 'tests.unit.web.test_views' has this __file__ attribute:
  /path/to/evalai/tests/unit/web/test_views.py
which is not the same as the test file we want to collect:
  /code/tests/unit/web/test_views.py
HINT: remove __pycache__ / .pyc files and/or use a unique basename for your test file modules
```

It appears that you are trying to run `pytest` in a docker container. To fix this, delete the `__pycache__` and all `*.pyc` files using the following command:

`find . | grep -E "(__pycache__|\.pyc|\.pyo$)" | xargs rm -rf`

#### Q. Getting the following error:

```
ERROR: for db Cannot start service db: driver failed programming external connectivity on endpoint evalai_db_1 (2163096de9aac6561b4f699bb1049acd0ce881fbaa0da28e47cfa9ca0ee1199f): Error starting userland proxy: listen tcp 0.0.0.0:5432: bind: address already in use
```

The following solution only works on Linux.

Execute :
`sudo netstat -lpn |grep :5432`

The output of the above would be in the following form:

```
tcp 0 0 127.0.0.1:5432 0.0.0.0:* LISTEN 25273/postgres
```

Execute the following command:

```
sudo kill 25273 ## This would vary and you can change with the output in the first step
```

#### Q. Getting the following error when using Docker:

```
ERROR : Version in "./docker-compose.yml" is unsupported. You might be seeing this error because you are using wrong Compose file version.
```

Since, the version of compose file is 3. You might be using a docker version which is not compatible. You can upgrade your docker engine and try again.

#### Q. Getting the following error while running `python manage.py runserver --settings=settings.dev`:

```
Starting the database seeder. Hang on...
Are you sure you want to wipe the existing development database and reseed it? (Y/N)
Exception while running run() in 'scripts.seed'
```

Try clearing the postgres database manually and try again.

#### Q. Getting the following error while executing `gulp dev:runserver`:

```
/usr/lib//nodejs/gulp//bin/gulp.js:132
	gulpInst.start.apply(gulpInst, toRun)l
				   ^
TypeError: Cannot read properly 'apply of undefined'
```

Execute the following command:

```
rm -rf node_modules/
rm -rf bower_components
npm install
bower install
```

#### Q. While trying to build EvalAI from the master branch and run the command docker-compose up:

```
ERROR: Service 'celery' failed to build: pull access denied for evalai_django, repository does not exist or may require 'docker login': denied: requested access to the resource is denied
```

Please make sure to clone EvalAI in its default directory with name evalai. This happens because the parent directory changes the name of docker images.
For instance, the image evalai_django gets renamed to evalai_dev_django if your directory is renamed to EvalAI_dev.
