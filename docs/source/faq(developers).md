Uninstall and then install karma again and also don't forget to clean the global as well as project npm cache. Then try again the step 8.

#### While running the unit tests, I am getting the error similar to as shown below:

```
________________ ERROR collecting tests/unit/web/test_views.py _________________
import file mismatch:
imported module 'tests.unit.web.test_views' has this __file__ attribute:
  /path/to/evalai/tests/unit/web/test_views.py
which is not the same as the test file we want to collect:
  /code/tests/unit/web/test_views.py
HINT: remove __pycache__ / .pyc files and/or use a unique basename for your test file modules
```

It appears that you are trying to run `pytest` in a docker container. To fix this, delete the `__pycache__` and all `*.pyc` files using the following command:

`find . | grep -E "(__pycache__|\.pyc|\.pyo$)" | xargs rm -rf`
