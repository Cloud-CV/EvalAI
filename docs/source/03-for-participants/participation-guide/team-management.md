# Team Management

Participant teams allow you to collaborate with others on a challenge. As a team admin (the creator of the team), you can manage your team members by adding or removing them.

## Adding Members to a Team

To add a new member to your participant team:

1.  **Navigate to Teams**: Go to the [Teams](https://eval.ai/web/teams/participants) page (accessible from the sidebar or your profile).
2.  **Select your Team**: Find the team you want to manage.
3.  **Invite Member**: Click on the **Add Member** icon (user with a plus sign) on the team card.
4.  **Enter Email**: In the modal that appears, enter the email address of the person you want to invite.
    -   **Note**: The user must already have an account on EvalAI.
    -   **Note**: A user cannot be invited if they are already part of another team participating in the same challenge.
5.  **Success**: Once invited, the user will be automatically added to your team.

## Removing Members from a Team

Only the team admin (creator) can remove members from a team.

1.  **Navigate to Teams**: Go to the [Teams](https://eval.ai/web/teams/participants) page.
2.  **View Members**: On the team card, you will see a list of current "Team Members".
3.  **Remove Member**: Click the **Trash** icon next to the name of the member you wish to remove.
4.  **Confirm**: The member will be removed from the team immediately.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> -   Admins cannot remove themselves from a team. If you are the admin and wish to leave, you must delete the entire team.
> -   Team members cannot be removed if the team has already made submissions to a challenge.

## Leaving a Team

If you are a member of a team (but not the admin), you can remove yourself from the team:

1.  **Navigate to Teams**: Go to the [Teams](https://eval.ai/web/teams/participants) page.
2.  **Remove Self**: Find the team and click the **Trash** icon next to your own name.
