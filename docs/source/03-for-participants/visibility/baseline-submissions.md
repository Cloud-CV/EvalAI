# Baseline Submissions

## What is a Baseline Submission?

A **Baseline Submission** is a special submission created by a Challenge Host that acts as a reference point on the leaderboard.  
Until a submission is marked as a baseline, it does not appear on the leaderboard for participants to compare their submissions.

## Why set a Baseline?

- Helps participants understand the minimum standard they should surpass.
- Provides an official benchmark to improve upon.
- Makes the leaderboard informative and engaging.

## How to Make a Submission a Baseline Submission

Follow these steps to mark a submission as a Baseline:

### 1. Go to the Challenge

- Navigate to your Challenge as a Host on the EvalAI platform.

### 2. Open the Challenge Leaderboard

- Go to the **Leaderboard** tab of your Challenge.

### 3. Select the Submission

- Identify the submission you want to mark as a Baseline.
- It can be your own submission or one submitted by another user (if permissions allow).

### 4. Mark as Baseline

- Look for the option or button to **Mark as Baseline**.  
  _(In the UI, it typically appears as a "B" badge or chip next to the submission on the leaderboard once marked.)_
- Click on it to confirm.

### 5. Verify

- Once marked, the submission should appear on the leaderboard as a Baseline submission.
- Participants will now see this Baseline score when viewing the leaderboard.

## Notes

- You can have multiple baseline submissions if needed.
- Only Challenge Hosts have permission to mark submissions as Baseline.
- Unmarking a Baseline is also possible if the host wishes to update it later.

By following these steps, Challenge Hosts can ensure that participants always have a clear target to aim for during the challenge.
