# Baseline Submissions

A **Baseline Submission** is a special submission created by a Challenge Host that acts as a reference point on the leaderboard.  
Until a submission is marked as a baseline, it does not appear on the leaderboard for participants to compare their submissions.

## Why Set a Baseline?

- Helps participants understand the minimum standard they should surpass.
- Provides an official benchmark for participants to improve upon.
- Makes the leaderboard informative and engaging by showing a reference performance.

## How to Make a Submission Baseline

Follow these steps to create, upload and mark a submission Baseline in EvalAI:

### Step 1: Prepare Your Baseline Submission

- Develop a solution or model that represents a reasonable starting point or minimal benchmark for the challenge.
- Ensure your submission complies with the challengeâ€™s submission format and requirements (e.g., correct output files, file format, metadata).

### Step 2: Submit the Baseline

- Log in to EvalAI as the Challenge Host.
- Navigate to the **Challenge Dashboard** and select your challenge.
- Go to the **Submit** tab.
- Upload your baseline submission just like a regular participant submission.

### Step 3: Open the My Submissions Tab

- After the submission is uploaded, go to the **My Submissions** tab of your challenge.

### Step 4: Locate the Submission

- Find the submission you just uploaded and want to mark as baseline.

### Step 5: Mark the Submission as Baseline

- Once the submission has passed the evaluation successfully, click the checkbox in the **Baseline** column next to the submission entry, .  

### Step 6: Confirm Baseline Display

- The baseline submission will now appear on the leaderboard with a "B" badge indicating a Basline submission.
- Participants will see this baseline as a reference when viewing the leaderboard.

## Managing Baseline Submissions

- You can have multiple baseline submissions if your challenge requires benchmarks for different metrics or tasks.
- Only Challenge Hosts have permission to mark or unmark submissions as baselines.
- If needed, you can unmark or replace a baseline submission at any time by following the same steps and unchecking previous submission's **Baseline** checkbox and marking a new submission as baseline to update it.

---

### Note:

- Choose a baseline that is meaningful and encourages participants to improve.
- Update baseline submissions periodically if better baseline models become available.
- Communicate clearly to participants what the baseline represents in the challenge overview or description.
