        EvalAI is built by a team of open source enthusiasts working at
        <a href="http://cloudcv.org" target="_blank" class="blue-text">CloudCV</a>. CloudCV aims to make AI research
        reproducible and easily accessible. We want to reduce the barrier to entry for doing research and make it easier
        for researchers, students and developers to develop and use state-of-the-art algorithms as a service.

      <p class="about-content">
        With EvalAI, we want to standardize the process of evaluating different methods on a dataset and make it simple
        to host a competition. Comparing a new method with other existing approaches is an essential component of
        research and this process has traditionally been affected by difference in evaluation metric implementation,
        different splits of the dataset or minor modifications in the algorithm. This makes it extremely hard to
        reproduce numbers from published papers and reliably compare your method with other existing approaches. By
        building EvalAI, we hope to make this easier by standardizing the dataset splits, evaluation metrics and by
        maintaining a public leaderboard of hosted challenges.
