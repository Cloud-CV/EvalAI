                <p class="text-med-black">EvalAI is built by a team of open source enthusiasts working at
                    <a href="https://cloudcv.org" class="blue-text" target="_blank">CloudCV</a>. CloudCV aims to make AI research
                    reproducible and easily accessible. We want to reduce the barrier to entry for doing research
                    and make it easier for researchers, students and developers to develop and use state-of-the-art
                    algorithms as a service.</p>
                <p class="text-med-black">With EvalAI, we want to standardize the process of
                    evaluating different methods on a dataset and make it simple to host a competition.
                    Comparing a new method with other existing approaches is an essential component of
                    research and this process has traditionally been affected by difference in evaluation
                    metric implementation, different splits of the dataset or minor modifications in the
                    algorithm. This makes it extremely hard to reproduce numbers from published papers
                    and reliably compare your method with other existing approaches. By building EvalAI, we
                    hope to make this easier by standardizing the dataset splits, evaluation metrics and by
                    maintaining a public leaderboard of hosted challenges.</p>
