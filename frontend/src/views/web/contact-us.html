						<ol class="faq-list">
							<h6>For everyone:</h6>
							<li><strong>What information should I include in my message?</strong><br>
								For a prompt resolution of your issue, please include the following details:
								<ol>
									<li>Challenge URL</li>
									<li>Challenge title</li>
									<li>Participant team name</li>
									<li>Submission PK if relevant</li>
									<li>Any other relevant information that will help us understand the issue</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li><strong>What happens if I do not provide enough detail?</strong><br>
								<b>Messages lacking sufficient detail may not be addressed</b>, as we receive numerous messages each day.</li>
						</ol>
						<ol class="faq-list">
							<h6>For participants:</h6>
							<li><strong>I am having trouble with accessing the data for a challenge.</strong><br>
								If you are having issues with getting data for a particular challenge, please reach out to the hosts directly.</li>
							<li><strong> I am unable to submit because the challenge has a `.edu` requirement.</strong> <br>
								Please reach out to the hosts directly for assistance.</li>
							<li><strong>I see a "Verify your email to continue" message despite having verified.</strong><br>
								If you encounter this message, please try using incognito mode or clear your browser cache.</li>
							<li><strong>Submission is stuck at submitted or running.</strong><br>
								Please provide the challenge URL and submission PK in the contact message below.</li>
							<li><strong>My team for the CARLA Autonomous Driving Challenge 2.0 (or a similar challenge) has not been accepted yet.
									What should I do?</strong><br>
								Please reach out to the hosts. This approval is managed at the host end.</li>
							<li><strong>I need to make changes (add/remove) to my participant team.</strong><br>
								This is not possible at the moment. We are looking into implementing a feature where you can unparticipate in a
								challenge if there are no submissions made for a challenge. Then, you may recreate a new participant team.</li>
						</ol>
						
						<ol class="faq-list">
							<li><strong>I need my challenge approved by the admin.</strong><br>
								Please create the challenge and make successful submissions for each phase. Then click on "Request for Approval" button on the challenge page. Any <b>request sent through contact form will not be entertained</b>. <br> Also, please do not spam us by repeatedly submitting the request using the button. We have added that feature for your convenience, use it wisely. </li>
							<li><strong>I am having trouble with downloading submissions from the "All Submissions" page. What should I do?</strong><br>
								This happens when there are too many submissions for the backend to compile. Please reach out to us with you challenge PK and we can download multiple submission files and share. However, please refrain from re-using the same challenge every year as that will keep worsening the issue.</li>
							<li><strong>I accidentally deleted my account. How can I restore it?</strong><br>
								Please make sure to be careful when dealing with these things. Send us a contact message with your user asking us to reactivate your account.</li>
							<li><strong>I found inconsistency with the documentation. What should I do?</strong><br>
								We appreciate any reports with issues in our documentation, please reach out to us and explain the problem clearly.</li>
							<li><strong>Is it possible to access the participants list or submissions for my challenge?</strong><br>
								Yes, please use the Analytics Dashboard to download the participant team or submission details. You might face issues downloading submission data for a challenge if there are too many entries. In that case, please reach out to us. In the future, we plan to implement a year-wise filter for downloading this data to reduce the load on the servers.</li>
							<li><strong>I am a new challenge host wanting to create a challenge. I would like to meet with the team to discuss my requirements.</strong><br>
								Thanks for using EvalAI. We have a detailed documentation on how to host challenges here: <a href="https://evalai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/host_challenge.html">Host a challenge</a>.
								We also have a starter template here: <a href="https://github.com/Cloud-CV/EvalAI-Starters">EvalAI Starters Template</a>. <br>
								Our recommendation is to go through the documentation and try to host a challenge and reach out to us with specific issues or questions. <br>
								Despite that, if you still feel the need, please reach out to us with your requirements and we will schedule a meeting
								with you.
								A few things to note:
								<ol>
									<li>We are non-profit, i.e. we do not charge the hosts for hosting challenges, although that may change in the future.</li>
									<li>We have a privacy policy, please read it here: https://eval.ai/privacy-policy/</li>
									<li>We are a small team, and while we do consider new features which may be general enough, we may not be able to accommodate all requests.</li>
									<li>If you are trying to host a docker-based challenge, then we request you to please arrange your own AWS account.</li>
									<li>We request you to please use remote evaluation servers (your own) if possible as that helps us save costs and sustain.</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li><strong>I am trying to create a challenge with remote evaluation. I need challenge primary key and queue details.</strong><br>
								Please enable `remote_evaluation: true` in your challenge configuration. Then, go to Manage Tab of your challenge to access the details. </li>
							<li><strong>I need to make all submissions for my challenge public.</strong><br>
								Unfortunately, we do not have support for this as of now. We are working on it and will update here once it is available.
								Also, please note to ask such questions <b>before</b> starting the challenge. We are usually unable to change such settings once the challenge has started and submissions are in.</li>
